# Store-Sales-Prediction

## Problem Arises
There's a store near my apartment that sells beautiful flowers, but I’ve noticed that they often face a challenge in managing their stock. Flowers, being perishable, only stay fresh for a few days before they start to wilt and become unsellable. This leads me to wonder: How can the store optimize its inventory so that they don’t end up with too many flowers that will go to waste or too few that they miss potential sales opportunities?

My idea is to help the store by developing a predictive model that can forecast future sales based on historical sales trends and external factors like holidays or weather. Additionally, I want to build an optimization model to recommend the ideal number of items to keep in inventory each week, ensuring that they can sell all of them before they perish or expire, without understocking. How can we maximize the profit of the store?

## Background
Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, selling millions of products across various categories. As competition continues to grow, accurately forecasting future sales is critical for optimizing inventory, managing supply chains, and planning marketing strategies. Effective sales prediction can help businesses make data-driven decisions, ensuring that the right products are in stock at the right time while minimizing overstock and understock situations.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can forecast future Amazon sales using historical sales data. By analyzing past sales trends, seasonal patterns, and other influencing factors, the model should predict future sales with a high degree of accuracy. This project will utilize time series analysis techniques to model sales fluctuations over time and provide actionable insights to inform inventory and marketing decisions.
